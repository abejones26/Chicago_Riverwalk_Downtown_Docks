# Boat Scraper

# Project Overview:

In 2019, users were able to falsify their boat specification while creating a reservation, which lead to a large profit lost for the company. In this repository, I am doing two things to prevent profit lost; Created and managing boat database with manufacturer verified specification and resevervation management dashboard.

Each section of this script would be run separately.  It requires that the boat_scraper.py script is running in another terminal window.  I will send that code next.  I put it in python file and ran it in the terminal using â€œpython boat_scraper.py
